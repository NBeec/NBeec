#### Main Focus! 🖥️

I'm mainly into cyber security it's like an addiction.... like real bad 😅

🔭 I’m currently working on: Golang based webshell 🐚
🌱 I’m currently learning: Blue Teaming Fundamentals

#### Some stuff that I know:
---
  - Azure
  - GCC
  - AWS
  - CloudFlare
  - Python
  - Golang
  - JS
  - Bash
  - Powershell
  - Bat
  - And the list goes on.

I may not be super good at them but I like to be a polyglot so I can read all the naughty exploits.
